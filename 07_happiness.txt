What is Happiness?
------------------
&nbsp;

[role="incremental"]
====

[quote, Dr. John A. Schindler]
____
Happiness is a state of mind in which our thinking is pleasant a good
share of the time.
____

Happiness is Good Medicine
--------------------------

[quote, Proverbs, King Soloman]
____
A merry heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit drieth up the bones.
____

* We think better, perform better, feel better & healthier when we're happy.

* Joy, rejoicing, thankfulness, and cheerfulness make you happier & healthier.

Happiness is Good Medicine
--------------------------

The old saying:

____
Be kind and loving to other people and you will be happy.
____

is backwards. It should be:

____
Be happy -- and you will be good, more successful, and healthier; you will feel and act more charitably towards others.
____

Misconceptions About Happiness
------------------------------

* It's not earned or deserved.

* It's not a moral issue.

[quote, Ethics, Spinoza]
____
Happiness is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself; nor do we
delight in happiness because we restrain our lusts; but, on the
contrary, because we delight in it, therefore are we able to restrain
them.
____

Pursuing Happiness is Not Selfish
---------------------------------

[role="incremental"]
* Many sincere people are deterred from seeking happiness because they
  feel that it would be ``selfish'' or ``wrong''.

* One of the most pleasant thoughts to any human being is the thought
  that he is needed, that he is important enough to help and add to
  the happiness of some other human being.

* Unselfishness does not lead to happiness: if we make a moral issue
  out of happiness and think of it as a reward for being unselfish, we
  will likely feel guilty about wanting happiness.

* __Unhappiness__ is the immoral behaviour: the attitude of
  unhappiness is not only painful, it is mean and ugly.

Happiness Does Not Lie in the Future but the Present
----------------------------------------------------

[role="non-incremental"]
[quote, Pascal]
____
We are never living, but only hoping to live; and, looking forward
always to being happy, it is inevitable that we never are so.
____

[role="incremental"]
* Happiness is a mental habit, a mental attitude, and if it is not
  learned and practiced in the present, it is never experienced.

* It cannot be made to wait for some external problem to be solved:
  I'll be happy when:

** I get married

** I get a better job

** Pay off my house

** My children graduate college

* If you wait for happiness to catch up with you, or ``just happen'',
  or be brought to you by others, you are likely to have a long wait.

Happiness is a Mental Habit Which Can be Developed
--------------------------------------------------

[quote, Abraham Lincoln]
____
Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.
____

* Happiness is purely internal. It is produced, not by objects, but by
  ideas, thoughts and attitudes which can be developed and grown,
  irrespective of the environment.

* We __react__ to petty annoyances and frustrations with grumpiness,
  dissatisfaction, resentment and irritability, purely out of habit.

Your Opinion Can Add to Unhappy Events
--------------------------------------

[quote, Epictetus]
____
Men are disturbed not by things that happen, but by their opinion of
the things that happen.
____

* Even in regard to tragic conditions, and the most adverse
  environment, we can usually manage to be __happier__, if not
  completely happy, by not adding to the misfortune our own feelings
  of self-pity & resentment, and our own adverse opinions.

The Attitude That Makes for Happiness
-------------------------------------

[quote, Robert Louis Stevenson]
____
The habit of being happy enables one to be freed, or largely freed,
from the domination of outward conditions.
____

[role="incremental"]
* Happiness __requires__ problems, plus a mental attitude that is
  ready to meet distress with action toward a solution.

** Have goals

** Strive toward them

* **Form the habit** of reacting aggressively and positively towards
  threats and problems.

* **Form the habit** of keeping goal-oriented all the time,
  regardless of what happens.

Systematically Practice ``Healthy-Mindedness''
----------------------------------------------

[quote, Ralph Waldo Emerson]
____
The measure of mental health is the disposition to find good
everywhere.
____

* Whether we hold a pessimistic and grumpy outlook, or an optimistic
  and happy outlook is largely a matter of selection, attention and
  decision.

* Deliberately choosing to have pleasant thoughts can have very
  practical results.

How to Learn the Happiness Habit
--------------------------------

[role="incremental"]
* Habits are reactions and responses which we have learned to perform
  automatically without having to ``think'' or ``decide''.

* Our self-image and our habits tend to go together; change one and
  you automatically change the other.

* You can change a habit simply by taking the trouble to make a
  __conscious decision__ -- and then by practicing or __acting out__
  the new response or behaviour.

* It requires constant watchfulness and practice until the new
  behaviour pattern is thoroughly learned.

Practice Exercise
-----------------

[role="incremental"]
* Discover how you habitually put on your shoes and __consciously
  decide__ to do it differently.

** Do this new way for 21 days

** Say each morning as you're putting on your shoes the new way:

[big]#&nbsp;#

[big]#I am beginning the day in a new and better way.#

Practice Exercise
-----------------

Consciously decide that throughout the day:

[role="incremental"]
. I will be as cheerful as possible.

. I will try to feel and act a little more friendly toward other people.

. I'm going to be a little less critical and a little more tolerant
    of other people, their faults, failings and mistakes. I will place
    the best possible interpretation upon their actions.

. Insofar as possible, I'm going to act as if success were inevitable,
  and I already am the sort of personality I want to be. I will
  practice ``acting like'' and ``feeling like'' this new personality.

. I will not let my own opinion color facts in a pessimistic or
  negative way.

. I will practice smiling at least three times during the day.

. Regardless of what happens, I will react as calmly and as
  intelligently as possible.

. I will ignore completely and close my mind to all those pessimistic
  and negative ``facts'' which I can do nothing to change.
